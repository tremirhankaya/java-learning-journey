# Java Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my personal journey of learning the **Java programming language**. It's a collection of **practice examples, mini-projects, and exercises** that cover everything from basic programming concepts to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and database integration.

Each project is designed to solidify my understanding of key concepts and build practical skills. Feel free to explore and use these examples as a resource for your own learning!

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Here you'll find practical examples on a variety of topics:

### Basic Programming Concepts
* **Arithmetic Operations:** Simple calculators and banking-related operations.
* **Conditional Statements:** Using `if` and `switch` statements for flow control.
* **Loops & Iteration:** Finding prime, friendly, and perfect numbers.
* **String Handling:** Checking for palindromes.
* **Arrays:** Sorting arrays and calculating averages.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting data using getters and setters.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Building a notification system and a basic game.
* **Abstract Classes:** Creating blueprints for database and price calculator projects.
* **Interfaces:** Defining a contract for a payment system.

### Mini-Projects & Algorithms
* **Loan Calculator:** A comprehensive project for loan calculations.
* **Cargo Tracking System:** An advanced project with **PostgreSQL** database integration.
* **Number Guessing Games:** Interactive games to practice logic and control flow.
* **File Operations:** Examples of reading from and writing to files.
